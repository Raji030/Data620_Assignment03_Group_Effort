It is now available as a CSV file on Stanford University's dataset collection site (SNAP, link: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/feather-deezer-social.html), from where we obtained it. The dataset has 28,281 nodes and 92,752 edges. Nodes represent users from European countries, and edges represent mutual follower relationships.The user (i.e. gender) is a categorical variable and in the target file, 0 represents Male and 1 represents Female. This dataset is suitable because it provides both the network structure and categorical variables for nodes, which are required for the assignment.\n",
